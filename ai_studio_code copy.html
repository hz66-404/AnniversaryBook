                    <h2>Why I want to make this e-book</h2>
                    <p>Hi Thao,

We’ve officially been together for a year now, and over the past year there have been so many things I’ve wanted to say to you, though sometimes my memory isn’t great and words don’t always manage to catch up with how I truly feel. I’m afraid that moments which feel natural and ordinary right now might slowly fade with time, and that’s why I wanted to write them down, to record how I came to like you, how we fell in love, and how, through living life together, you’ve quietly changed me little by little. I’ve always loved keeping records, because I believe some feelings belong only to the “us” of this moment, and once they pass, they can never be fully brought back. Perhaps many years from now, when we look through this e-book again, we’ll understand it differently, but the feelings we have right now, this sincerity and excitement, are unrepeatable, and that’s what makes them so precious. This is my gift to you for our first anniversary, and I truly hope you like it. I’ve always believed that making something by hand is a very romantic thing to do, because it represents time, patience, and care. I tried my best to make this look nice, using your favorite color, pink, and I hope that starting from this year, I can keep improving it year after year, just like us in real life, slowly adjusting and growing until we find the way that suits us best. You deserve the most precious gifts in the world, and this one exists only for you.

Love,
Han

                    <p>
                        I don’t think I’ve ever properly said how I slowly fell for you. Looking back now, so many moments have become unexpectedly clear.

The first time you came to my place, I already felt something. You seemed to carry a kind of sunlight with you. That day, you had your hair clipped back with a cute hairpin, your face looked bright and glowing, and your big round eyes kept blinking in a way that made it hard not to look at you a little longer. You were cheerful and open, and when we were playing card games together, I remember thinking to myself how nice it would be if we ended up on the same team.

At first, what made me notice you might have been your attractive and adorable appearance. But what truly made me want to see you again and again, and slowly grow closer to you, was your personality. I wanted to know you better, so I asked what kind of Vietnamese songs you liked. When you told me that you actually didn’t listen to Vietnamese music at all, I remember thinking, this girl is really interesting—and kind of cute.

                    <p>
                        Your kindness, your optimism, and the way you treat your friends with genuine warmth all deeply drew me in. I still remember my birthday, when you and Anne surprised me together. Growing up, I wasn’t often surrounded by people who would carefully prepare something by hand or truly remember my birthday. That moment made me realize how happy it feels to be thought of, and without noticing it myself, I found myself moving a little closer to you again.

Later on, the moment I truly felt that you were someone who shared my values and had your own independent way of thinking was the night we opened a bottle of wine in my room. I still remember it was a bottle of rosé. My English wasn’t great, and I didn’t even fully understand the questions, but you patiently explained everything to me in English, again and again. I don’t remember exactly what I said that night, and I’m not even sure how much of it you understood. I only remember looking into your big eyes and suddenly feeling a little lost, as if I couldn’t even tell what I was saying anymore.

                        You are cute. You are unapologetically yourself. You have strong values, a kind heart, an optimistic spirit, and sometimes you’re a little silly(in a cute way). All of these could easily be reasons for me to fall in love with you. But over time, I came to feel that loving someone shouldn’t need reasons at all. I fell in love with you simply because you are you, because of the unique light you carry, and that alone is enough.

I just started wanting to see you more, wanting to ask what you were doing, wanting to be part of your everyday life. It feels like my heart realized I liked you long before my mind ever did.

                    <h2>How you’ve quietly changed me</h2>
                    <p>Looking back on this past year, I can clearly see how much I’ve changed. And a big part of that change comes from having you by my side, constantly giving me positive and steady influence.

Throughout this year, we tried many new things together. More importantly, when it comes to interacting with others and communicating, I’ve learned so much from you. You seem to have a natural ability to connect with people. Almost everyone ends up wanting to keep talking to you within just a couple of minutes of meeting you. Being around you has quietly encouraged me to become more confident and more willing to reach out and talk to others.

Sometimes we talk about deeper topics. You always speak with clarity and confidence, and you’re also honest enough to point out my shortcomings. Instead of feeling discouraged, I’ve learned to think in a more open and diverse way because of you. I’ve always admired how genuine you are with your friends. You know how to nurture relationships, whether it’s through small surprises or thoughtful gestures. And when you encounter people whose values don’t align with yours, you have the courage to speak up directly. When I think about it, I realize that in this way, we’re actually quite similar.</p>

                        Over this year, I’ve also become much bolder in the way I handle things. I know that whenever my interests are at stake, whenever I’m in a position where I need support, you will always stand by me. We’ve overcome one challenge after another together, and that sense of standing side by side has given me so much confidence.

I’ve always been a bit impatient, and when I’m not thinking rationally, you’re the one who helps me calm down. Whether it’s when I impulsively want to send an angry email, or when we’re at the casino and I can’t resist wanting to go all in, you’re always the one who pulls me back. Looking back now, I realize that these moments, which seemed light and ordinary at the time, were quietly shaping me.

I’ve also made a lot of progress in practical skills. We baked cakes together, and after cooking coriander beef with you, I came to realize that cooking isn’t nearly as difficult as I once thought. These small, everyday experiences have given me more confidence in myself.

                        Another thing I truly admire about you is your independence. We are both international students who traveled far from home to live in a foreign country, yet you always manage to take such good care of yourself. You’re also incredibly brave. When you injured your little finger, you didn’t panic or cry, while I was the one who felt far more scared. That kind of courage has influenced me in ways I didn’t even notice at first.

The most important way you’ve changed me is this: in the past, whenever I faced difficulties, I felt like the world was about to collapse. Now, I’m able to take things step by step and learn to solve problems on my own. You’ve taught me so much about how to interact with others and navigate relationships, and you’ve helped me learn how to stand more firmly in this world.

I believe this is one of the reasons why I’ve been able to grow so quickly over the past year.

                    <h2>The Things We Did Together This Year</h2>
                    <p>
This year, we did a lot of things together.
Before I start, I should probably say this first: if I forget something, please don’t be mad at me. My memory really isn’t great, and I don’t think you remember everything perfectly either. Still, even if some details have become blurry, there are certain moments that remain very clear in my mind.

We went to the US together and celebrated Lunar New Year, and I even received a red envelope in Vietnamese dong. You came to watch my drumming performance. We went golfing several times and celebrated AP’s birthday together. On Valentine’s Day, we had a small hot pot dinner, then went to Edinburgh, had pho at Haymarket—which I thought was decent—and also ate some Chinese street barbecue. You helped me cut my toenails, complaining the whole time but still doing it anyway. You even applied to be a ring girl, which is still really funny to think about now.

We went to the Dra Ball together. I started learning DJing and even played music for you at your place. We downloaded an app to look at Jupiter, and ended up freezing outside late at night. You bought me a pair of shark slippers—do you remember? I couldn’t even fit into them. Chupan came to visit us, and we went to Dundee together. That dessert shop there was really good. We also made dumplings together, and around that time I received a verbal offer from CSLA.

                        We went to watch Fight Night. You were angry that day—although I don’t really remember why anymore, I clearly remember that you were genuinely angry. Later, I gave a PechaKucha presentation, and you came to support me. You told me I did really well, even though I was so nervous I felt like I might pee my pants. You cooked, and we sat together outside the Chem Building. I wanted to take a photo of you, but you didn’t let me. I suspected you might be angry again, but I had no proof, so I named that photo “Female celebrity refuses to be photographed.”

I made mushroom sliders for the first time. They were actually a bit too greasy, and you probably didn’t like them very much, but you still ate a few to support me. In April, I started working as a greenkeeper. I had to wake up very early every day, but somehow that period made me quite happy. Later, on my birthday, you made my favorite chocolate mousse for me and printed out photos of me in black and white. Even though black-and-white photos are considered unlucky in Chinese culture, I was still deeply touched.

                       We went to Edinburgh again. I remember you were probably angry that day too. Later, I took you to eat at Castle Course and showed you where I worked. The weather was really nice that day. My band performed again, although the performance wasn’t great that time. We went to a networking event together. I went to Costco for the first time and bought a lot of beef. You thought it was too expensive, but you didn’t scold me—probably because I was spending my own money, haha.

You wore your red gown and we went to take photos together. Your dissertation. You also bought me ice cream—it was really good. You took photos of me and my car. Later, we went to watch the torch procession. There isn’t much space left, so I can only rush through the rest. Your graduation soak—you didn’t wear a sexy swimsuit, minus points. We made bracelets together. You ran 10 kilometers, which is honestly so impressive. You also came with me to play sports and helped carry my bag. And I think it was that day when you accidentally hit my head.

Looking back, some of these things were important, and some of them were very small. But put together, they became our entire year.

                        We also went strawberry picking together. They were really sweet and delicious. After that, we went to play golf. That time we actually played on the course together. I played terribly, but I was still really happy. There was also a day when I went for a club fitting. I was in great form that day and played really well, and you even helped record videos for me. Thinking about it now still makes me feel very happy. We went to buy hats together, but none of them fit your head. That night, we had some really good cheese with Bia and the others.

We also went to the coffee shop in Crail that my coworker recommended. Later, we went to Tenerife together. On that trip, I remember you getting angry again… and again… and again. But I also played a lot of golf. We saw dolphins and volcanoes. You went diving, and I went paragliding. We really were a couple who went up into the sky and down into the sea. To be honest, I don’t really like it when we argue a lot while traveling, and I was a bit tired during that time. But after we came back, we ate Korean BBQ together, and I bought my new golf clubs. I was genuinely very happy that day.

After that, we went to eat malatang and also went to the casino. Both were really fun. Then you graduated, and suddenly time fast-forwarded into summer. You went back to Vietnam, but we kept video calling. Every time we talked, I could see your little cat, and you always showed me so many delicious Vietnamese foods.

                        Later, when my semester started, you came to St Andrews to visit me. We went to the rooftop of Rusacks and had a very expensive meal, but the view was really beautiful. You cooked me a small fried chicken rice dish and even wore my chef’s hat. Around that time, I bought you a Labubu. Your teeth look just like Labubu’s, which still makes me laugh when I think about it.

During the month you stayed in St Andrews, I was actually very busy. But we still carved pumpkins together. Before you left, I noticed you were secretly crying because I hadn’t spent enough time with you. But you managed to comfort yourself very quickly. Looking back now, that moment feels a little funny and a little tender at the same time.

Later, you came back again and even won first place in a gym competition. I also managed to take a photo of you picking your toes. Then you left again. After that, I received my offer. The next time we met was in London. We ate lots of good food, but the next day my stomach acted up, and I couldn’t go to Winter Wonderland.

                        Later, I went back to China, and once again we couldn’t see each other. But just before the winter break ended, I went to London to see you. During that time, I was very lazy and stayed at home every day, while you found a cute job taking care of children. The way you earned money was actually quite sexy. We ate pho twice, and both times it was really good. We even went to buy underwear together, which still feels very funny to think about now.

You’re about to come to St Andrews so we can spend Valentine’s Day together.
I’m really looking forward to it.

                    <h2>What We Can Do Together in the Future</h2>
                    <p>When I think about the future, I hope we can live together. If we can’t do that right away, I still hope we’ll keep trying to move toward it. Even if it takes time, the direction feels clear to me. I imagine us cooking together every day, watching TV in the evenings, going to the gym, and traveling together whenever we have holidays, exploring the world side by side.

If we could have one or two pets at home, I think life would feel even more lively. You like big dogs, and I like small dogs. You like children, and I do too. But I feel that before thinking seriously about having kids, I want us to focus on doing the things we want to do for ourselves first. Raising a child feels like a huge responsibility to me. I worry about not teaching them well, about them picking up bad habits, being bullied, feeling too much pressure, or about me not being able to give them a good life. So for now, I value the idea of taking care of “us” before anything else.

When it comes to us, I really look forward to learning new sports together, like tennis or skiing. And if you end up liking golf, that would be even better. Golf has mostly been my passion, but I’m truly grateful that you’ve always supported me so wholeheartedly. That means a lot to me.</p>

                    Another thing that feels very important is taking good care of our health. In that, I still have a lot to learn from you. I don’t really know what the future will look like, but I feel that life should be both calm and full of passion at the same time.

If we ever have the chance, I also hope that one day I’ll be brave enough to be honest with my parents about our relationship. I’m not always that courageous yet, but I want to keep it on my future to-do list.

As for the future itself, I think it’s about staying healthy, continuing to learn, and not losing our curiosity or desire to explore life. And if all of that happens with you by my side, I feel like that would already be enough.

I also hope you’ll get angry a little less, and that we’ll support each other more. Being angry isn’t good for the body, and I’d rather we always stand together.

What I want you to know is that you’ve always been part of my plans for the future.

                    <h2>And now, to what I’m grateful for.</h2>
                    <p>When it comes to gratitude, I realize there is so much I want to be thankful for.

First, I want to thank your parents, and I also want to thank my own. If our life paths had differed even slightly—if I hadn’t gone abroad, or if you hadn’t chosen St Andrews—we might never have met. Our parents gave us such good environments to grow up in, shaping us into the people we are today: independent, kind, and capable of supporting and understanding one another. Sometimes I feel that the fact we were able to meet at all is already a rare kind of blessing.

I also want to thank us. Thank us for being independent and brave, for being kind and warm-hearted. Every day, we face the world and its challenges, and so many things can only be handled by ourselves. But we’ve handled them well. We’ve grown well. We’ve taken good care of ourselves. You’ve always taken such good care of your health, and I still have more to learn from you.

I’m deeply grateful for the friends around us. Without Xujun, we probably wouldn’t have met at all. Our friends have always been kind and understanding toward us. We’re lucky to be surrounded by people who aren’t driven by jealousy, calculation, or meanness. And when we do encounter such people, we’ve learned to step away. Having such a warm and healthy circle of friends is something I truly appreciate.

Finally, I want to thank the universe. The fact that we are still safe and healthy is, to me, the greatest happiness of all.

I hope we can continue like this for a long time.
